# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

## Introduction

Welcome to the **alx-project-0x02-setup** repository. This project serves as a comprehensive introduction to setting up and working with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of building modern, scalable web applications using these powerful technologies.

## Project Description

This repository contains the initial setup and structure for a modern web application built with:

- **Next.js** – A React framework for production-ready applications with built-in routing, SSR, and performance optimizations.
- **TypeScript** – A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, providing safer and more maintainable code.
- **Tailwind CSS** – A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs without leaving your HTML.

The project guides you through:

- Scaffolding a new Next.js application
- Integrating TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Creating reusable and interactive UI components
- Setting up routing
- Fetching and managing data from external APIs
- Maintaining a clean and scalable folder structure

## Objective

The primary objective of this repository is to set up and document the foundational structure of a Next.js project. It will serve as a boilerplate or starting point for future development work and experimentation with modern web technologies.
